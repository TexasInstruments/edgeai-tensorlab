# Object Detection From Images

- **[edgeai-mmdetection](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/edgeai-mmdetection)** can be used to train low complexity models as well as export them into a format that TIDL can understand. It is an extension of [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection), which is a popular open source object detection training repository. 

- A few object detection models are also being added to **this** repository - these models are still in developmet and some of them may not be fully supported in in TIDL.
