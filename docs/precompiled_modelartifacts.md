# Pre-complied / pre-imported model artifacts

This package provides Pre-Compiled Model Artifacts for several Deep Neural Network models. 
- URLs of Pre-compiled model artifacts can be obtained [in this folder](../modelartifacts/)

## These artifacts can be used for inference in multiple ways: 

#### For inference/benchmark in [edgeai-benchmark](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/edgeai-benchmark)

#### In EdgeAI SDKs of the supported SoCs **[PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-SK-TDA4VM](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-SK-TDA4VM)**



Note: The tasks performed by the pre-compiled model artifacts can be identified using the following fields in their names:
- cl: Image Classification Models
- od: Object Detection Models (COCO Object detection, Face detection)
- ss: Semantic Segmentation Models
- kd: Keypoint Detection Models (Human Pose Estimation)
- de: Depth Estimation
- lidar-3dod: 3D Object detection using LIDAR input
- 6d-pose: 6D Pose estimation of objects (3-Translation, 3-Rotation)
