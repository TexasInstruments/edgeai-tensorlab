# Usage

Compiling a DNN model is the process of quantizing and converting the model into a format that can be inferred with TIDL. TIDL (and its open source front ends) provides utilities to compile models. The imported artifacts can then be used to run inference.

In addition to what is provided with TIDL, this repository provides igh level utilities for compiling DNN models. These tools include dataset loaders, pre-processing utilities, post-processing utilities and metric computation utilities.


## Components of this repository
This repository is generic and can be used with a variety of runtimes and models supported by TIDL. This repository contains the following parts:

- **edgeai_benchmark**: Core scritps for core model compilation, inference and accuracy benchmark scripts provided as a python package (that can be imported using: *import edgeai_benchmark* or using: *from edgeai_benchmark import*)
- **scripts**: These are the top level python scripts - to compile models, to infer and do accuracy & performance benchmark, to collect accuracy report and to package the generated artifacts.
- **configs**: These are the actual configurations of to run the models in the model zoo. These configurations define the Dataset parameters, pre-processing, inference session parameters and post-processing.

The top level python **scripts** are launched via bash scripts in the root of this repo. Each bash script has a `--help` flag to describe its purpose and usage. 


## Running inference / benchmark on *PC* using pre-compiled model artifacts
[run_benchmarks_pc.sh](../run_benchmarks_pc.sh) is the main script in this repository that does compilation of models and benchmark. Usage is
```
run_benchmarks_pc.sh <SOC> [-d|--debug] [-h|--help]
```

*modelartifacts_path* in the [settings_base.yaml](../settings_base.yaml) file indicates the location where the artifacts are generated or expected. It currently points to work_dirs/modelartifacts/<SOC>/

We have a symbolic link in this repository that points to the corresponding folder in edgeai-modelzoo. 

If this is present, compilation will be skipped, those model artifacts will be downloaded automatically and inference/benchmark will be performed.

The `--debug` flag allows for the attaching of a debugpy debugger to the top level python script. Call the script with `--help` for more information.


## Compile models in the model zoo

[run_benchmarks_pc.sh](../run_benchmarks_pc.sh) is the main script in this repository that does compilation of models and benchmark. However, there are a few things to note:
* Model compilation can be run only on PC. The device does not support model compilation.
* However, the inference of a compiled model can be run on PC or on device. 
* For the models in the model zoo, we have provided (link to) pre-compiled artifacts in edgeai-modelzoo and this repository has a symbolic link to that. If you would like to use the latest compiled artifacts, then pull the edgeai-modelzoo repository.
* If you like to do the compilation of these models yourself, you can either rename the folder [work_dirs/modelartifacts](../work_dirs/modelartifacts) or change the value of *modelartifacts_path* in [settings_base.yaml](../settings_base.yaml). 
* While running this script, compilation of models in the model zoo will be performed as the first step before the inference. But if the pre-compiled model artifacts are present, model compilation will be skipped. param.yaml file present in each model artifacts folder indicates that the model compilation is complete.
* result.yaml file, if present in each model artifacts folder indicates that the model inference is complete. If result.yaml is present, inference is also skipped. Manually delete result.yaml if it is present (i.e. if you have done it once already) to do the inference - otherwise, the script will merely print the result information from result.yaml.
* Multiple models can be run in parallel in PC (only) by using run_benchmarks_parallel_pc.sh and also by setting parallel_processes option to a higher value (for example 4 or 8). parallel_processes can either be set in [settings_import_on_pc.yaml](../settings_import_on_pc.yaml) or passed as a commandline argument to the following script. For example:

```commandline
run_benchmarks_parallel_pc.sh AM68A --parallel_processes 8
```

## Compiling with a custom model or custom configuration
To compile a custom model or a custom pipeline configuration, first, compose a custom configuration in `/scripts/benchmark_custom.py`.
* For a simple example of setting up a custom pipeline configuration, reference `/tutorials/tutorial_classification.ipynb` or `/tutorials/tutorial_detection.ipynb`.

Next, launch the custom configuration by calling 
```
run_custom_pc.sh <SOC> [-d|--debug] [-h|--help]
```

## Generating reports
A consolidated CSV report containing all your benchmarking results can be generated by running [run_generate_report.sh](../run_generate_report.sh)
```
run_generate_report.sh [-d|--debug] [-h|--help]
```

## Packing the artifacts to be used for inferece in the EVM
* The imported artifacts can be used to run inference on the target device (eg. EVM)
* If you have compiled models yourself and would like to run those model artifacts in the target device, run the script 
[run_package_artifacts_for_evm.sh](../run_package_artifacts_for_evm.sh) to package the artifacts for use in the target device.
```
run_package_artifacts_for_evm.sh <SOC> [-d|--debug] [-h|--help]
```
* These packaged artifacts can be copied to the device to run inference there.
* Please note the above comment about result.yaml. These result files are removed while packaing the artifact to be used in EVM (as we actually want to run the inference in EVM). Instead of using the packaging script, you can use the compiled model artifact directory as well, but be sure to remove the result.yaml if you actually want the inference to run.
* Change the modelartifacts_path in settings.yaml to point to the correct modelartifacts path. For example, after packaging, the packaged folder name will be <SOC>_package. To use this packaged artifacts, set modelartifacts_path accordingly.


## Sharing files between PC and EVM
* Copying datasets and compiled artifacts to EVM can be time consuming and can use significant disk space (which may not be available on the EVM).
* To run on EVM, we recommend to share your the datasets and work_dirs folders in your PC to the EVM and using NFS. [exportfs](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/exportfs.htm) can be used for this NFS sharing.

## Debugging
To debug the python scripts in `/scripts/`, which are called from the top level bash scripts, use `debugpy`'s attach capability. 

For all bash scripts with `debugpy` launching supported, use `./<SCRIPT.sh> --debug` to enable debugging. Then, for every call of a python script, `debugpy` will wait for a debugger to attach to the process. 

To see which scripts are `debugpy` enabled, use the `--help` flag to see if `--debug` is supported.

### Attaching with VSCode
1. Ensure that the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Python Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy) extensions are installed
2. Create a debug `launch.json` configuration similar to the following, filling out `<HOSTNAME>`:
```
"configurations": [
    {
        "name": "Python: Remote Attach",
        "type": "debugpy",
        "request": "attach",
        "connect": {
            "host": "<HOSTNAME>",
            "port": 5678
        },
        "justMyCode": false

    },
]
```

See [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging#_example) for more information about debugpy in VSCode.

### Attaching with other IDEs
Users of other IDEs must research how to attach a debugpy client in the IDE of their choice.
