# Pre-Complied Model Artifacts

DNN Models and pre-compied model artifacts are provided in another repository called **[EdgeAI-ModelZoo](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/edgeai-modelzoo)**. 

Please clone that repository. After cloning, edgeai-benchmark and edgeai-modelzoo must be inside the same parent folder for the default settings to work.

In this repository, we have created a symbolic link [modelartifacts](../work_dirs/modelartifacts) to the actual modelartifacts folder in edgeai-modelzoo.
