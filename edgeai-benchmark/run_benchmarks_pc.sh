Usage: $0 [OPTIONS] [TARGET_SOC]
This script sets up the environment and runs benchmarking on x86 PC for a specified target device by calling the following:
    ./scripts/benchmark_modelzoo.py
    ./scripts/generate_report.py

For more precise configuration of benchmarking, see the CLI options available within ./scripts/benchmark_modelzoo.py.

Options:
-d, --debug     Launch the Python script with debugpy for remote attach.
-h, --help      Display this help message and exit.

TARGET_SOC:
Specify the target device. Use one of: TDA4VM, AM62A, AM68A, AM69A. Defaults to TDA4VM.
Note: Until r8.5, only TDA4VM was supported.

Debug Mode:
If debug mode is enabled, the script will wait for a debugpy to attach at ${HOSTNAME}:${PORT}.
See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging#_example for more info on using debugpy attach with VS Code.

Example:
$0 # defaults to TDA4VM, no debug
$0 [-d|--debug] AM62A # select device with debug
