Usage: $0 [OPTIONS] [TARGET_SOC]
This script generates a CSV summary of the results of a benchmarking session by calling:
    ./scripts/generate_report.py

Options:
-d, --debug     Launch the Python script with debugpy for remote attach.
-h, --help      Display this help message and exit.

TARGET_SOC:
Specify the target device (optional). Use one of: TDA4VM, AM62A, AM68A, AM69A, AM67A.
Default behaviour is to report all results present in modelartifacts_path

Debug Mode:
If debug mode is enabled, the script will wait for a debugpy to attach at ${HOSTNAME}:${PORT}.
See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging#_example for more info on using debugpy attach with VS Code.

Example:
$0 # defaults to None, no debug
$0 [-d|--debug] AM62A # select device with debug

            exit 0
