# ColPali

## Overview

The *ColPali* model was proposed in [ColPali: Efficient Document Retrieval with Vision Language Models](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.01449) by **Manuel Faysse***, **Hugues Sibille***, **Tony Wu***, Bilel Omrani, Gautier Viaud, C√©line Hudelot, Pierre Colombo (* denotes equal contribution). Work lead by ILLUIN Technology.

In our proposed *ColPali* approach, we leverage VLMs to construct efficient multi-vector embeddings directly from document images (‚Äúscreenshots‚Äù) for document retrieval. We train the model to maximize the similarity between these document embeddings and the corresponding query embeddings, using the late interaction method introduced in ColBERT.

Using *ColPali* removes the need for potentially complex and brittle layout recognition and OCR pipelines with a single model that can take into account both the textual and visual content (layout, charts, etc.) of a document.

## Usage

This example demonstrates how to use *ColPali* to embed both queries and images, calculate their similarity scores, and identify the most relevant matches. For a specific query, you can retrieve the top-k most similar images by selecting the ones with the highest similarity scores.

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image

from transformers import ColPaliForRetrieval, ColPaliProcessor

model_name = "vidore/colpali-v1.2-hf"

model = ColPaliForRetrieval.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="cuda:0",  # or "mps" if on Apple Silicon
).eval()

processor = ColPaliProcessor.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Your inputs (replace dummy images with screenshots of your documents)
images = [
    Image.new("RGB", (32, 32), color="white"),
    Image.new("RGB", (16, 16), color="black"),
]
queries = [
    "What is the organizational structure for our R&D department?",
    "Can you provide a breakdown of last year‚Äôs financial performance?",
]

# Process the inputs
batch_images = processor(images=images).to(model.device)
batch_queries = processor(text=queries).to(model.device)

# Forward pass
with torch.no_grad():
    image_embeddings = model(**batch_images).embeddings
    query_embeddings = model(**batch_queries).embeddings

# Score the queries against the images
scores = processor.score_retrieval(query_embeddings, image_embeddings)
```
