# FBGEMM FP8

With FBGEMM FP8 quantization method, you can quantize your model in FP8 (W8A8):
- the weights will be quantized in 8bit (FP8) per channel
- the activation will be quantized in 8bit (FP8) per token

It relies on the [FBGEMM](https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM) library which provides efficient low-precision general matrix multiplication for small batch sizes and support for accuracy-loss minimizing techniques such as row-wise quantization and outlier-aware quantization. 

> [!TIP]
> You need a GPU with compute capability>=9 (e.g. H100) 

Before you begin, make sure the following libraries are installed with their latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade accelerate fbgemm-gpu torch
```

If you are having issues with fbgemm-gpu and torch library, you might need to install the nighlty release. You can follow the instruction [here](https://pytorch.org/FBGEMM/fbgemm_gpu-development/InstallationInstructions.html#fbgemm-gpu-install-libraries:~:text=found%20here.-,Install%20the%20FBGEMM_GPU%20Package,-Install%20through%20PyTorch)


```py
from transformers import FbgemmFp8Config, AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B"
quantization_config = FbgemmFp8Config()
quantized_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto", quantization_config=quantization_config)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
input_text = "What are we having for dinner?"
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")

output = quantized_model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=10)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

A quantized model can be saved via "saved_pretrained" and be reused again via the "from_pretrained".

```py
quant_path = "/path/to/save/quantized/model"
model.save_pretrained(quant_path)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(quant_path, device_map="auto")
```
