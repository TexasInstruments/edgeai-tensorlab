tidl_meta_arch.proto file is borrowed from TIDL package. In TIDL package this file is present at ti_dl/utils/tidlMetaArch. If any change in this file in TIDL pacakge happens then it has to be udated here also to make generated protext file to work with TIDL. 

Any update in .proto file needs compilation of proto file, and for that execute the script "compile_proto.sh" though command "./compile_proto.sh"
