## Abstract

In this paper, we propose a long-sequence modeling framework, named StreamPETR, for multi-view 3D object detection. Built upon the sparse query design in the PETR series, we systematically develop an object-centric temporal mechanism. The model is performed in an online manner and the long-term historical information is propagated through object queries frame by frame. Besides, we introduce a motion-aware layer normalization to model the movement of the objects. StreamPETR achieves significant performance improvements only with negligible computation cost, compared to the single-frame baseline. On the standard nuScenes benchmark, it is the first online multi-view method that achieves comparable performance (67.6% NDS & 65.3% AMOTA) with lidar-based methods. The lightweight version realizes 45.0% mAP and 31.7 FPS, outperforming the state-of-the-art method (SOLOFusion) by 2.3% mAP and 1.8x faster FPS.

## Abstract

Recently 3D object detection from surround-view images has made notable advancements with its low deployment cost. However, most works have primarily focused on close perception range while leaving long-range detection less explored. Expanding existing methods directly to cover long distances poses challenges such as heavy computation costs and unstable convergence. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel sparse query-based framework, dubbed Far3D. By utilizing high-quality 2D object priors, we generate 3D adaptive queries that complement the 3D global queries. To efficiently capture discriminative features across different views and scales for long-range objects, we introduce a perspective-aware aggregation module. Additionally, we propose a range-modulated 3D denoising approach to address query error propagation and mitigate convergence issues in long-range tasks. Significantly, Far3D demonstrates SoTA performance on the challenging Argoverse 2 dataset, covering a wide range of 150 meters, surpassing several LiDAR-based approaches. Meanwhile, Far3D exhibits superior performance compared to previous methods on the nuScenes dataset. The code is available at [this URL](https://github.com/megvii-research/Far3D). 


## Introduction

We implement and provide the results and checkpoints for StreamPETR and Far3D on the NuScenes and PandaSet dataset.

## Dataset Preperation

### NuScenes

Prepare the nuScenes dataset as per the MMDetection3D documentation [NuScenes Dataset Preperation](../../docs/en/advanced_guides/datasets/nuscenes.md). 

After downloading nuScenes 3D detection dataset and unzipping all zip files, we typically need to organize the useful data information with a `.pkl` file in a specific style. To prepare them with NuScenes dataset for StreamPETR and Far3D, run the following command:

```bash
python tools/create_data.py nuscenes --root-path ./data/nuscenes --out-dir ./data/nuscenes --extra-tag nuscenes --strpetr
```

The directory structure after processing should be as below.

```

```

### PandaSet

Download `pandaset.zip` from [HERE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/georghess/pandaset/tree/main) and unzip the file in `./data/pandaset`. Then run the following command to prepare `.pkl` files for StreamPETR and Far3D:

```bash
python tools/create_data.py pandaset --root-path ./data/pandaset --out-dir ./data/pandaset --extra-tag pandaset --strpetr
```

The directory structure after processing should look like:

## Get Started

Refer the MMDetection3D documentation [Test and Train with Standard Datasets](../../docs/en/user_guides/train_test.md) for general floating point training/evaluation/testing steps for standard datasets. Use the below steps for training and evaluation of StreamPETR and Far3D:

1. cd to installation directory <install_dir>/edgeai-mmdetection3d

2. Do floating-model training using the command 
    "./tools/dist_train.sh <config_file> <num_gpus>"

    For example, to use 2 GPUs use the command

    ```bash
    # StreamPETR with NuScenes
    ./tools/dist_train.sh projects_edgeai/Far3D/configs/nuscenes/streampetr_r50_256x704_bs4_seq_24e.py 2

    # StreamPETR with PandaSet
    ./tools/dist_train.sh projects_edgeai/Far3D/configs/pandaset/streampetr_pandaset_r50_256x704_bs4_seq_24e.py 2

    # Far3D with NuScenes
    ./tools/dist_train.sh projects_edgeai/Far3D/configs/nuscenes/far3d_vovnet_gridmask_960x640.py 2

    # Far3D with PandaSet
    ./tools/dist_train.sh projects_edgeai/Far3D/configs/pandaset/far3d_pandaset_vovnet_gridmask_960x640.py 2

    ```

3.  Do evalution using the command 

    "python <config_file> <latest.pth file generated from previous step #2>" 

    For example,

    ```bash
    # StreamPETR with NuScenes
    python ./tools/test.py projects_edgeai/StreamPETR/configs/nuscenes/streampetr_r50_256x704_bs4_seq_24e.py ./work_dirs/streampetr_r50_256x704_bs4_seq_24e/epoch_24.pth

    # StreamPETR with PandaSet
    python ./tools/test.py projects_edgeai/StreamPETR/configs/pandaset/streampetr_pandaset_r50_256x704_bs4_seq_24e.py ./work_dirs/streampetr_pandaset_r50_256x704_bs4_seq_24e/epoch_24.pth

    # Far3D with NuScenes
    python ./tools/test.py projects_edgeai/Far3D/configs/nuscenes/far3d_vovnet_gridmask_960x640.py ./work_dirs/far3d_vovnet_gridmask_960x640/epoch_24.pth

    # Far3D with PandaSet
    python ./tools/test.py projects_edgeai/Far3D/configs/pandaset/far3d_pandaset_vovnet_gridmask_960x640.py ./work_dirs/far3d_pandaset_vovnet_gridmask_960x640/epoch_24.pth
    ```
    Note: This is single GPU evalution command. "./dist_test.sh" can be used for multiple GPU evalution process.

## Results

The following results are for StreamPETR and Far3D with NuScenes and PandaSet. Note that these resutls are from the trainged models through 24 epochs. Trained models with more epochs, e.g., 60 or 90, will provide better accuracies. Far3D didn't work well with PandaSet, which need to be furtur investigated.
