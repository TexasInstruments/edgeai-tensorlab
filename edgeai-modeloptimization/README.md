# EdgeAI-ModelOptimization


## EdgeAI-TorchModelOpt
* [EdgeAI-TorchModelOpt Documentation](./torchmodelopt/README.md) - Tools and utilities to help the development of embedded friendly DNN(Deep Neural Network) Models in [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org) - we call these **model optimization tools**. They include Model Quantization, Sparsity and Model Surgery to enable faster implementation on the mobile devices. 


## ONNX Model Optimizer
* [TIDL ONNX Model Optimizer](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/edgeai-tidl-tools/tree/master/scripts/osrt_model_tools/onnx_tools/tidl-onnx-model-optimizer) - This module contains various modifications and optimizations on the original ONNX graph and generates a new optimized ONNX model with the same functionality as the original model but with a more optimized structure for TIDL-RT inference.
