- Prune/sparsify a model: [edgeai_torchmodelopt.xmodelopt.pruning](./pruning/v2) - Both structured and unstructured pruning is supported. Structured pruning includes N:M pruning and channel pruning. Here, we provide with a few parametrization techniques, and the user can bring their own technique as well and implement as a part of the toolkit.<br>

- Channel Pruning/Sparsity uses torch.fx to find the connections and obtain a smaller network after the training with induced sparsity finishes. 

The detailed usage for the API is documented in [Model Sparsity](./v2/README.md).

## Results

Here are the results on pruning the network with n:m pruning and channel pruning using our blending based pruning algorithm.

Below are the results with networks having 30% channel sparsity. These networks could give upto 50% FLOP reduction and double the speedup.
After obtaining 30% channel sparsity, only 70% of the channels remain and the operations (MACs) are dependant on the square of the parameters. Thus, 49% of the operations remain and thus would lead to 51% FLOP reduction.

Here are the results on 41:64 (n:m) pruning, that comes up to 0.640625 pruning ratio.
