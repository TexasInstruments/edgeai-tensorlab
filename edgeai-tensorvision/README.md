Model Training Scripts & Examples For Embedded AI Models - in PyTorch.

<hr>

## Introduction
This code provides a set of low complexity deep learning examples and models for low power embedded systems. Low power embedded systems often requires balancing of complexity and accuracy; this is a tough task that requires significant amount of expertise and experimentation. In addition, we would like to bridge the gap between Deep Learning training frameworks and real-time embedded inference by providing ready to use examples and scripts for training, validation and complexity analysis.
