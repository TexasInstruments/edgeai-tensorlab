# Quantization

Model Optimization Tools including Quantization Aware Training (QAT) have moved - please visit the new location: https://github.com/TexasInstruments/edgeai-modeloptimization

Note: Pytorch based model training tools are in the folder [torchmodelopt](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/edgeai-modeloptimization/tree/main/torchmodelopt). The model training [scripts in this repository](../../references) make use of [torchmodelopt](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/edgeai-modeloptimization/tree/main/torchmodelopt). Read its documentation, clone that repository and run its setup to install the model optimization tools provided there.
