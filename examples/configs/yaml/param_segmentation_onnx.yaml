# Type of task that this model performs.
# Options: classification, detection, segmentation
task_type: segmentation

# Parameters used for pre-processing the input
# Currently supported pre-processing operations are
#   resizing, croping, mean subtraction, reversing channels (eg. RGB to BGR)
preprocess:
  # Backend resizer module
  # Options: cv2, pil
  backend: cv2

  # Crop size - used to crop the resized input.
  # Options: a single integer or a list of two integers.
  #   if this is a single integer, a square crop is done.
  #   if this is a list [height,width], a rectangular crop is done.

  # Data layout of the input tensor to be given out of pre-processing.
  # Options: NHWC, NCHW
  #   Typically tensorflow/tflite models use NHWC format, where as PyTorch/onnx models and MXNet models use NCHW format.

  # Actual pixel interpolation type to be used the resizer.
  # If the backend is cv2, these interpolation modes are valid:
  #   cv::INTER_NEAREST, cv::INTER_LINEAR, cv::INTER_CUBIC, cv::INTER_AREA (default is cv::INTER_LINEAR)
  #   https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/da/d54/group__imgproc__transform.html
  # If the backend is pil, these interpolation modes are valid:

  # Resize size - used to resize the input.
  # Options: a single integer or a list of two integers.
  #   if this is a single integer, the smallest side of the image is resized to this size.
  #   if this is a list [height,width], a rectangular resize is done to fit the size exactly.
